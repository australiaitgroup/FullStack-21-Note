# Lecture 23 React Part 7 Thinking in React

## 1. Thinking in React
Application -> Component -> Different State -> State Data Flow -> UI

### 1.1 React Developing Procedure
1. Step 1: Break the UI into a component hierarchy 
1. Step 2: Build a static version in React 
1. Step 3: Find the minimal but complete representation of UI state 
1. Step 4: Identify where your state should live 
1. Step 5: Add inverse data flow 

### 1.2 Team Work
1. Junior developers dont know if they meet the standards 
2. Focus on teamwork rather than nitpicking technical details.
    - Divide into epic, story, and task, and then break it down further for team work
      - **Step 1**: Break the UI into a component hierarchy 
        > dont over engineering, Only divide the parts that are about to start development, which typically isn't the entire website. 
        > - Question：
        >   - 如果不over engineering，如何解决在未来中可能存在的可复用组件呢？
        > - Answer:
        >   - readable(through SOLID principle), maintainable, reuseable 以应对以后可能存在的各种情况
          ```
          example:
          
          - APP
            - Header
              - Logo
              - Button (Post a task)
              - Navigation
              - Authentication
              - Button (become a Tasker)
            - Banner
              - BackgroundImage
              - Button (Post your task)
              - Button (Earn money as a tasker)
              - AirtaskData

          可复用组件：
            Button
          ```
          ```
          From: 
            -> Alice: Story 1, Bod: Story 2;
            
          To:
            -> Alice: Button, Bob: Banner(background image);
            -> Alice: PR for button, Bob: Review, Team: Merge;
            -> Bob: merge main into local branch, use button for Banner;
          ```
          > The salary of a junior developer is half that of a senior developer, but their performance should be at 80% of a senior developer's, 使用无脑的套路
          
          > When dividing components, don't think about functionality implementation.

      - **Step 2**: Build a static version in React 
        - No need for interaction, no need for functionality, only consider styling.
          - CSS + HTML
          - reset: reset-css
          - normalize css: Normalize.css
        - reuse and props
          - 静态区别 (不是有用户交互产生的区别: 使用 props)
            - 内容区别 (props)
            - 样式区别 (props, states)
              - BEN 中的 Modifier
              - 通读并背诵 MUI 的文档（可以死记硬背, 随手能写出来是 senior 的基本功，对于junior 应该没有 knowledage gap）
                - variant
                - color
                - size
                - isActive
                - isDisabled 
                - ... 20 个左右
              - classname 库
          - 动态区别 (使用 state)

### 1.3 React Debug 
- learn common bug
  - not defined
  - not found
  - ...

## 2. Git and Github
- Protocol
  - Git
  - SVN
- Product
  - Github
  - Bitbucket
> Git !== Github

### 3. 补充
> You shouldn't give a black-and-white answer to any interview question; especially you shouldn't directly answer with "no"；

> When writing code as a team, you don't need to consider other people, but you should write readable, maintainable code；

> Some package mentioned：react-icon, classnames；

> When encountering copy and paste, deduplicate it. Aim to implement all reuse in the form of components rather than variables, and ensure that each file contains only one component；

> As a junior developer, you should be able to write code like a senior developer and fully understand the SOLID principles.
